# Agent file

The purpose of this tile is to describe common mistakes and confusion points that agents might encounter as they work in this project. If you ever encounter something in the project that surprises you, please alert the developer working with you and indicate that this is the case in the AgentMD file to help prevent future agents from having the same issue.

## Idea transcription rule

Whenever a developer describes a detailed vision for a TODO idea (I1–I10 or design choice), the agent must transcribe the full description verbatim (or faithfully condensed) into the relevant TODO.md entry before any implementation work begins.
